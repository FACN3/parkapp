# :deciduous_tree::deciduous_tree::evergreen_tree: **CITY PARKS** :evergreen_tree::deciduous_tree::deciduous_tree:

### [Founders & Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/) have been working with the [Gallilee Society](http://www.gal-soc.org/) to produce an MVP ready apps to help solve some of their most challenging problems.

Take a look at our MVP: [LINK](https://parkappfac.herokuapp.com/)

## The Why?

The challenge was to build an MVP App that improves information and access to
city parks for the Arab population in Israel

## Requirements

* Mobile, UI/UX First
* Arabic Language
* Improving accessiblilty to city parks in Israel
  #### Shaping our thinking
* I want to know what is available locally
* I want to know what I can do at that location
* I want to know what the best way is to get there
* I want to know whether I can park there and what accessibility is like
* I want to know what other people think of the location as a rating or review
* I want to know what activities are available that I can do with my kids

## What & Where

We created a MVP centered around a Israel map interface. Users could access the
map (Google Map API), select Israeli city park locations, search locations by
proximity and then go to pages with appropriate information about the park
selected. There were links to additional information, directions that could be
used with the Waze App. We provided the user to filter results based on
particular categories or to search by these. Each park was therefore tagged with
particular activities which is had.
